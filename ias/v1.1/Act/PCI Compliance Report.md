title: "PCI Compliance Report"
excerpt: ""
---
The [PCI Standard](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) is mandated by payment card brands and administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. The standard was created to increase controls around cardholder data to reduce credit card fraud. Because the standard is complex, it can be difficult to translate data into actionable tasks that will help achieve compliance. To help reduce complexity, you can run the InsightAppSec PCI scan. 

The scan will help you prepare for an audit, an assessment or a questionnaire around PCI compliance.  Uncovering potential issues that will affect the outcomes of any of these exercises allows you to take action and secure critical vulnerabilities on any assets that deal with credit/payment card data.  

# Generating a PCI Compliance Report

The InsightAppSec PCI scan checks online properties for issues such as insecure data collection forms, cookie presence, third-party links, cross-site-scripting vulnerabilities, and SQL-injection vulnerabilities, and it generates an automatic checklist of potential compliance issues. By taking advantage of this information, you can proactively filter and prioritize identified issues to ensure faster remediation of your organization's most critical regulatory compliance concerns.

After you've run a scan against your web applications that handle PCI data, you can generate a PCI report, which will help you easily identify PCI requirements that have been passed or failed. 

To create a PCI report, click on the **Generate Report** button and select the PCI compliance report.
