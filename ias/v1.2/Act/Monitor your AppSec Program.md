You can hover over any data point for more information and click on the tile links for a more detailed view of the scan data. For example, clicking the link below the ‘Completed Scans Today’ tile takes you to the [Scanning Activity](doc:monitor-your-appsec-program#section-monitor-scanning-activity-across-apps) screen.  
You can use the homepage dashboard to review a number of key statistics:
  * Running scans
  * Failed scans today
  * Completed scans today
  * Scheduled scans
  * Interrupted scans
  * Scan usage this month
  * Apps scanned this month
  * Apps with most vulns
  * Apps with most links
  * Top vulnerability types

## Monitor Scanning Activity across Apps

The Scanning Activity screen provides an overview of the app scanning activity in your portfolio. You can use this screen to quickly learn about the status of active scans as well as the high-level results (vulnerability count, risk level) of past scans. You can use the date range filter to focus on scans that occurred between a certain time period, and use the scan activity chart to learn about scanning trends in your portfolio. 
If you are interested in scan results for a specific app, you can click on the app name in the Scanning Activity table, or visit the Apps tab. You can also click on a scan name to bring up individual scan details.
