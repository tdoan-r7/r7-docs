|Arbitrary File Upload | Arbitrary File Upload module checks the application for vulnerabilities that allows to upload file. The consequences of unrestricted file upload can vary including complete system takeover an overloaded file system forwarding attacks to backend systems and simple defacement. It depends on what the application does with the uploaded file including where it is stored. | Vulnerability | Active|
|ASP.NET Misconfiguration | ASP.NET Misconfiguration module verifyes that ASP.NET debugging is disabled. | Vulnerability | Active|
|Blind SQL | Blind SQL module checks the application for the attacks are identical to normal SQL Injection except that when an attacker attempts to exploit an application rather then getting a useful error message they get a generic page specified by the developer instead. This check corresponds to the OWASP Top-10 Vulnerability A1 (Injection) | Vulnerability | Active|

|Cross Origin Resources Sharing (CORS) | "Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows JavaScript on a web page to make XMLHttpRequests to another domain not the domain the JavaScript originated from. Such ""cross-domain"" requests would otherwise be forbidden by web browsers per the same origin security policy. CORS defines a way in which the browser and the server can interact to determine whether or not to allow the cross-origin request. It is more useful than only allowing same-origin requests but it is more secure than simply allowing all such cross-origin requests." | Best Practice | Active|
|Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | "The Cross-Site Checking module tests the application for susceptibility to embedded script attacks. If the application does not filter certain HTML tags and syntax, then a user would be able to embed malicious code that targets other users. Vulnerabilities discovered by this module can result in stolen passwords, stolen Cookie values, and social engineering attacks. This check corresponds to the OWASP Top-10 Vulnerability A4 (Cross-Site Scripting Flaws). Additional information describing this type of vulnerability is available from CERT Advisory CA-2000-02." | Vulnerability | Active|

|Expression Language Injection | "The Expression Language Injection module tests the application for susceptibility to Java servlet vulnerabilities involving values passed by attribute that are double evaluated by the servlet code processing them. This allows attackers to embed code that for example dereferences software objects or ""models"" and exposes their contents in the client browser. This vulnerability is specified on OWASP's website <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Expression_Language_Injection"">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Expression_Language_Injection</a>.

It downloads JAR files extracts and decompiles class files and examines their content for security-related code. If the application places too many security-related functions in user-accessible JAR files or applets then an attacker could reverse-engineer those functions. Vulnerabilities discovered by this module may be simple code-disclosure problems or they could be as severe as obtaining database connection strings or encryption keys. <br/>This does not correspond to a specific OWASP Top-10 Vulnerability but it illustrates vulnerabilities of inadequate code management and protection of sensitive application data. | Vulnerability | Active|

|OS Commanding | OS Commanding module checks the application for vulnerabilities that allows an attacker to inject and execute commands specified by the attacker in the vulnerable application. In situation like this the application which executes unwanted system commands is like a pseudo system shell and the attacker may use it as any authorized system user. However commands are executed with the same privileges and environment as the application has. Command injection attacks are possible in most cases because of lack of correct input data validation which can be manipulated by the attacker (forms cookies HTTP headers etc.). | Vulnerability | Active|
