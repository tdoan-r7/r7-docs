Welcome to InsightAppSec!
To help you maximize your time, weâ€™ve created a checklist of important capabilities to explore in your new DAST tool.

  Here are some of the things you will learn how to do:
  * Scan your own domain or one of the pre-configured Rapid7 domains
  * Customize your scan using scan configuration settings
  * View and filter vulnerabilities in your environment based on the needs of your business
  * Share vulnerability data and showing value to rest of your organization using reports
  * Tune and adjust your scans using authentication and scan templates
  * Verify remediated vulnerabilities using the "Attack Replay" capabilities of the Rapid7 AppSec Chrome extension
  * Set up an on-premise scan engine

Have questions? You can find our contact information at the top right side of the application.
