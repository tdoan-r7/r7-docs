One of the biggest challenges SecOps professionals face is communicating the importance of improving their business's security posture, while showing the value of its investments to various groups within the organization. InsightAppSec makes it easy with reports that target the priorities of different groups within an organization. For example, you can present the Vulnerability Summary report to the leadership group for tracking improvements while app developers can use a CSV export which they can import into their issue tracking tool. 

As part of this objective, you must select the vulnerabilities found in your last scan, click the **Generate Report** button and examine the reports generated by InsightAppSec. The [Generate Reports](doc:generate-reports) guide has more details on the reporting feature while the [PCI Compliance Report](doc:generate-reports#section-payment-card-industry-report) guide describes how you can create a report for the Payment Card Industry standards.
