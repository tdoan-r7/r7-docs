[Apps](doc:concepts#section-apps) are a way to group your targets together, which in turn allow you to tune scans consistently for all targets in a single grouping, to group results into one place, and to track improvements over time. Start by clicking the **Add App** button on the *All Apps* screen which will reveal the *Add App Wizard*. You can use this wizard to set App-level configurations such as base URLs and users.

On the Target URLs step, use the **+** button to add individual URLs, or click on the **Bulk Add URLs** link to add multiple URLs, e.g. to copy a list of URLs from an external document.  
From the Users step, you can assign users to a particular App. 
Completing the wizard takes to the home page inside the App, where your next step is to create a [Scan Configuration](doc:scan-configuration).
