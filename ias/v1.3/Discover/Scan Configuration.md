A scan configuration, or scan config, is a group of settings you can use to scan a particular app. By creating a scan config, you can save a particular configuration of options, and use it to scan that app with those options again and again.

You can create multiple scan configs per app in order to address different needs. For example, you might want to scan your app weekly with the default attack template, and monthly with the SQL Injection and XSS template.

This section discusses the available options within a scan config.
