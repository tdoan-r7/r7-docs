The Schedule section lets you schedule periodic scans by specifying the frequency and the date and time for the first scan to begin. For example, you can create multiple apps related to the login, admin, and user activity sections of your app and schedule them to be tested for vulnerabilities at different times of the month, in order to balance the load on your network.

You can also schedule [blackouts](doc:concepts#section-blackout) for times when there is heavy user traffic on your application. Blackouts can be one-time or recurring, and you can configure the start and end times for a blackout.
