Having mostly used default settings in the past scans, this is a good time to explore the customizations available as part of the Scan Configuration tool. The webscantest and hackazon apps accept Basic and Form authentication, but you can also try [authentication](doc:authentication) on your own apps and experience improved scan results. In addition, we encourage you to try new [attack templates](doc:attack-templates) (e.g. SQL Injection + XSS), and restricting the scan to a small subsection of the site using the [scan scope](doc:scan-scope) capability.
