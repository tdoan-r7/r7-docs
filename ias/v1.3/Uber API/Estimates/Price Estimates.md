title: "Price Estimates"
excerpt: "The Price Estimates endpoint returns an estimated price range for each product offered at a given location. The price estimate is provided as a formatted string with the full price range and the localized currency symbol.<br><br>The response also includes low and high estimates, and the [ISO 4217](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency code for situations requiring currency conversion. When surge is active for a particular product, its surge_multiplier will be greater than 1, but the price estimate already factors in this multiplier."
