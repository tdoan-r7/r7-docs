Setting user password policies for criteria such as size, complexity, or expiration is a security best practice that makes it difficult for would-be attackers to brute-force or guess passwords. Your organization may also mandate this practice as a security control.

If you are a Global Administrator, you can create a password policy by taking the following steps:
1. Click the **Administration** tab.
2. In the _Users_ area of the _Administration_ page, select the **password policy** link.
3. On the _Password Policy_ page, enter a unique name to help you identify the policy.
4. Select values for the following password attributes as desired:
 * the number of days that elapse, after which the password expires
 * the maximum number of characters
 * the minimum number of characters
 * the required number of special characters; supported characters include the following: 
`~!@#$%^&*()-_=+[{]}\\|;:\'\"<,>./?
 * the required number of numerals
 * the required number of capital letters
5. Click **Save**.

If you set a expiration window, the expiration date and time appears in the _Users_ table, which you can see by selecting the **manage** link for Users on the _Administration_ page.
