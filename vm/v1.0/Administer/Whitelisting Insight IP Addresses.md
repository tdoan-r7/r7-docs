title: "Whitelisting Insight IP Addresses"
excerpt: ""

Rapid7 provides a list of static IP addresses that you may use to whitelist traffic originating from the Insight platform to your on-premise JIRA or container registries.  These IP addresses are used for outbound traffic originating from InsightVMâ€™s automated ticketing and container features. Whitelisting these IP addresses will allow ingress traffic from the Insight platform to communicate with JIRA servers you host and private container registries behind a firewall, allowing you to utilize container and automated ticketing with JIRA features.

We will avoid changing these IP addresses unless absolutely necessary. If we must make changes, we will update this page.
