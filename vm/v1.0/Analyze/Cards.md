# Overview

InsightVM features a substantial number of specialized cards that you can use to monitor network data, almost all of which are interactive.  Available functions differ by the type of card being used.

# Data types

Explore the card library to gain visibility on the following metrics affecting your network:

* Agents
* Assets
* Containers
* Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
* Remediations
* Risk
* Sites
* Vulnerabilities, both in general and specific to high-profile exploits

# Presentation types

Cards display their data in several different ways.  The following types are among the most common:

## Pie chart

        "https://files.readme.io/3af0327-card_interact.gif",
        "card_interact.gif",
        335,
        398,
        "#685254"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Pie charts show data subdivided by category.  Each section displays  details on mouseover.  Click any section to isolate its data in tabular form.

## Table

        "card_interact_table.gif",
        666,
        392,
        "#424d57"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Click available column headers to toggle record sorting by ascending or descending order.  Additionally, click the “Name” link of any row to see a detail page for that particular item.

## Number

        392,
        "#4a5660"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

These cards reduce their data to a single number.  Many can be refined with options provided in a dropdown menu.

## Stacked area

        391,
        "#52555c"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Stacked area cards function as multi-layered line graphs.  Use these cards to compare changes across several metrics over a time period you specify.

# Expanded views

The majority of cards offered through InsightVM are comprised of individual asset and vulnerability records.  These expandable cards contain additional details and features.

Browse to an applicable card and click **Expand Card >**.

Expanded cards offer the following capabilities:

* Query filtering - see [Advanced filter options](doc:advanced-filter-options) for instructions.
* Remediation project creation - see [Remediation Workflow](doc:remediation-workflow) to learn more about this feature.
* Sortable data tables:
 * Links to asset or vulnerability detail pages
 * CSV export options

## Card data tables

        2664,
        704,
        "#3b4751"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Use the tables in expanded cards to examine individual vulnerability or asset records.  These records are also sortable by column, and clicking any “Name” link will take you to a detail page for that record.

### Open detail drawers

        "#3d4954"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Click anywhere within a table row to open a detail drawer for that record.  Detail drawers provide quick looks at further record information without navigating away from the table itself.

### Export to CSV
