The cards found in the built-in dashboard templates can be deleted and other cards added to create a custom dashboard experience suited to your security needs. You can customize any existing dashboard, including the default dashboard, or create a new dashboard from a template to customize. To learn how to create a new dashboard, see [Viewing and working with dashboards](doc:viewing-and-working-with-dashboards).

To begin customizing a dashboard, first navigate to it by clicking the **downward-facing arrow** next to the name of the dashboard you are currently viewing and selecting the dashboard you would like to customize.

##Moving a card

You can customize the way that your dashboard displays by moving existing cards around. To move a card, move your cursor to the name of the card until it changes into a four-way arrow

By holding down your mouse button, you can move the card to any spot on your dashboard.

##Renaming, duplicating, or deleting a dashboard

Any dashboard can be duplicated or renamed; dashboards that are not your Default one can be deleted. To rename, duplicate, or delete a dashboard, move your cursor to the name of that dashboard. While your cursor hovers on or near the name of the dashboard, you will see, from left to right, an **edit icon**, a **duplicate icon**, and a **delete icon**.

Clicking any of the icons will trigger a pop-up where you can make the change to that dashboard. Click the OK button to confirm your change.
