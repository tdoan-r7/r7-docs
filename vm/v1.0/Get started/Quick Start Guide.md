Welcome to InsightVM!

This guide is designed to accompany you throughout your trial experience of our agent-powered vulnerability management solution.  In the course of your trial, we recommend that you complete four important milestones:

* [Set up the Insight Agent](doc:set-up-the-insight-agent)
* [Understand Risk with Live Dashboards](doc:understand-risk-with-live-dashboards)
* [Remediate Risk](doc:remediate-risk)
* [Assess Containers](doc:assess-containers)

# Before you begin

Before you get started, make sure that you do the following things:

* Confirm your email and create a password for your Insight account.
* Make sure your browser meets the [system requirements](https://www.rapid7.com/products/insightvm/system-requirements/).

# What will I see during the trial?

This InsightVM agent-powered trial is designed to quickly demonstrate the capability of cloud-based vulnerability management.  You will get a first-hand look at how InsightVM uses the Insight Agent to power dashboards, cards, remediation projects, and container assessment.

# What will happen to my data?

Since this is a trial experience, feel free to experiment, observe, and learn as you progress through the milestones.  If you become an InsightVM subscriber after your trial, your data **will not be carried over** to your new environment.

Think of this as a first look into what InsightVM can do when deployed in your organization.
