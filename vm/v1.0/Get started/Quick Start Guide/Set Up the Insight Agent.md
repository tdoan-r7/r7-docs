# What is the Insight Agent?

The Insight Agent is a data collection tool that exists on each of your organization’s assets.  When the agent detects a change in status, it sends an update to the Insight platform to determine what to do next.  Depending on the type of status update received, your Insight products will automatically respond with analysis tasks of their own.  This service-based deployment is what makes InsightVM’s more robust assessment features possible—all without the costly processing overhead of traditional collectors.

# Install the Insight Agent

To learn how to deploy the agent, please see [Installing the Insight Agent](https://insightagent.help.rapid7.com/docs/installation).  Make sure to follow the steps for the OS of your desired endpoint.

The Insight Agent’s lightweight design will ensure that the accessibility of your asset remains unburdened during the collection process.  Depending on your network configuration, the agent can take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour to collect some workable data.
