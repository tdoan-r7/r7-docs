# What are dashboards?

Dashboards are fully customizable views of specialized cards that provide live monitoring of your network.  You can build new dashboards based on Rapid7 templates or start fresh with your own.  You are in full control of which cards you see and where you see them.  See [Dashboards](doc:dashboards) to learn how to use these.

# Explore the dashboard library

Take a look at some of InsightVM’s pre-built dashboards to see how your assessment data can be presented in meaningful ways.

# Create a new dashboard

Build a custom view of your data that allows you to focus on the assets that pose the greatest risk to your organization.  See [Cards](doc:cards) to learn how your data can be presented in different ways.

# Refine card data

Many cards contain more detail and functionality than can be shown in collapsed form on your dashboard.  Try expanding a card to get a better look at the data being represented.  From this view, you can look at individual rows, select and view individual data sets, apply filters, and create remediation projects.  See [Advanced filter options](doc:advanced-filter-options) to learn more.
