This page concerns installation procedures for InsightVM software and the Nexpose Appliance.

##Can I install InsightVM on a system that already has PostgreSQL installed?

No. InsightVM includes its own instance of PostgreSQL. To ensure that it runs properly, you have to stop and remove any instances of PostgreSQL on the host system before installing InsightVM.

##I'm trying to reinstall InsightVM but my license key doesn't work.

InsightVM license keys can only be used once. Contact [Rapid7 Technical Support](mailto:support@rapid7.com) to obtain a new license key.

##How do I make InsightVM start as a daemon in Linux?

If you disabled the intialize/start option as part of the installation, you will need to start InsightVMmanually.

To start InsightVM from the command line, take the following steps:
1. Go to the directory that contains the script that starts InsightVM:
```$ cd [installation_directory]/nsc```

2. Run the script:
```$ ./nsc.sh```
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "warning",
  "body": "To detach from a InsightVM screen session, press CONTROL and type a and then d. Do not use CONTROL-c, which will stop InsightVM."
}
[/block]
The installation creates a daemon named nexposeconsole.rc in the /etc/init.d/ directory.

To manually start, stop, or restart the daemon:
1. Go to the /nsc directory in the installation directory:
```$ cd [installation_directory]/nsc```

2. Run the script to start, stop, or restart the daemon. For the security console, the script file name is nscsvc. For a scan engine, the service name is nsesvc:
```$ ./[service_name] <start|stop>```

To prevent the InsightVM daemon from automatically starting when the host system starts:
```$ update-rc.d [daemon_name] remove```

####I can't start my appliance.

First, make sure that the Appliance is plugged into a power source. Then press the Select button, which has the green checkmark (Ã¼), on the front panel.  If you continue to have difficulty, contact Rapid7 Technical Support.

##How do I change the time on the Nexpose Appliance?

Using the buttons on the front panel of the Appliance, go the Date/Time submenu under the **Configure** menu in the LCD. There, you can set a new time.

##How do I uninstall InsightVM software?

Each instance of InsightVM must be installed from scratch. If you need to reinstall the program, you must first remove it. Multiple copies of the same instance of the product will not function correctly and are not supported.
