All discovered vulnerabilities appear in the Vulnerabilities table of the Security Console Web interface. Your organization can exclude certain vulnerabilities from appearing in reports or affecting risk scores.

##Understanding cases for excluding vulnerabilities

There are several possible reasons for excluding vulnerabilities from reports.

_Compensating controls_: Network managers may mitigate the security risks of certain vulnerabilities, which, technically, could prevent their organization from being PCI compliant. It may be acceptable to exclude these vulnerabilities from the report under certain circumstances. For example, the application may discover a vulnerable service on an asset behind a firewall because it has authorized access through the firewall. While this vulnerability could result in the asset or site failing the audit, the merchant could argue that the firewall reduces any real risk under normal circumstances. Additionally, the network may have host- or network-based intrusion prevention systems in place, further reducing risk.

_Acceptable use_: Organizations may have legitimate uses for certain practices that the application would interpret as vulnerabilities. For example, anonymous FTP access may be a deliberate practice and not a vulnerability.

_Acceptable risk_: In certain situations, it may be preferable not to remediate a vulnerability if the vulnerability poses a low security risk and if remediation would be too expensive or require too much effort. For example, applying a specific patch for a vulnerability may prevent an application from functioning. Re-engineering the application to work on the patched system may require too much time, money, or other resources to be justified, especially if the vulnerability poses minimal risk.

_False positives_: According to PCI criteria, a merchant should be able to report a false positive, which can then be verified and accepted by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) or Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) in a PCI audit. Below are scenarios in which it would be appropriate to exclude a false positive from an audit report. In all cases, a QSA or ASV would need to approve the exception.

Backporting may cause false positives. For example, an Apache update installed on an older Red Hat server may produce vulnerabilities that should be excluded as false positives.

If an exploit reports false positives on one or more assets, it would be appropriate to exclude these results.

##Understanding vulnerability exception permissions

Your ability to work with vulnerability exceptions depends on your permissions. If you do not now know what your permissions are, consult your Global administrator.

Three permissions are associated with the vulnerability exception workflow:

* Submit Vulnerability Exceptions: A user with this permission can submit requests to exclude vulnerabilities from reports.
* Review Vulnerability Exceptions: A user with this permission can approve or reject requests to exclude vulnerabilities from reports.
* Delete Vulnerability Exceptions: A user with this permission can delete vulnerability exceptions and exception requests. This permission is significant in that it is the only way to overturn a vulnerability request approval. In that sense, a user with this permission can wield a check and balance against users who have permission to review requests.

##Understanding vulnerability exception status and work flow

Every vulnerability has an exception status, including vulnerabilities that have never been considered for exception. The range of actions you can take with respect to exceptions depends on the exception status, as well as your permissions, as indicated in the following table:

[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "If the vulnerability has the following exception status...",
    "h-1": "...and you have the following permission...",
    "h-2": "...you can take the following  action:",
    "0-0": "never been submitted for an exception",
    "0-1": "Submit Exception Request",
    "0-2": "submit an exception request",
    "1-0": "previously approved and later deleted or expired",
    "1-1": "Submit Exception Request",
    "1-2": "submit an exception request",
    "2-0": "under review (submitted, but not approved or rejected)",
    "2-1": "Review Vulnerability Exceptions",
    "2-2": "approve or reject the request",
    "3-0": "excluded for another instance, asset, or site",
    "3-1": "Submit Exception Request",
    "3-2": "submit an exception request",
    "4-0": "under review (and submitted by you)",
    "4-2": "recall the exception",
    "5-0": "under review (submitted, but not approved or rejected)",
    "5-1": "Delete Vulnerability Exceptions",
    "5-2": "delete the request",
    "6-0": "approved",
    "6-1": "Review Vulnerability Exceptions",
    "6-2": "view and change the details of the approval, but not overturn the approval",
    "7-0": "rejected",
    "7-1": "Submit Exception Request",
    "7-2": "submit another exception request",
    "8-0": "approved or rejected",
    "8-1": "Delete Vulnerability Exceptions",
    "8-2": "delete the exception, thus overturning the approval"

###Understanding different options for exception scope

A vulnerability may be discovered once or multiple times on a certain asset. The vulnerability may also be discovered on hundreds of assets. Before you submit a request for a vulnerability exception, review how many instances of the vulnerability have been discovered and how many assets are affected. It’s also important to understand the circumstances surrounding each affected asset. You can control the scope of the exception by using one of the following options when submitting a request:

* You can create an exception for _all instances_ of a vulnerability on all affected assets. For example, you may have many instances of a vulnerability related to an open SSH port. However, if in all instances a compensating control is in place, such as a firewall, you may want to exclude that vulnerability globally.
* You can create an exception for _all instances of a vulnerability in a site_. As with global exceptions, a typical reason for a site-specific exclusion is a compensating control, such as all of a site’s assets being located behind a firewall.
* You can create an exception for _all instances of a vulnerability on a single asset_. For example one of the assets affected by a particular vulnerability may be located in a DMZ. Or perhaps it only runs for very limited periods of time for a specific purpose, making it less sensitive.
* You can create an exception for _all instances of a vulnerability on an asset group_. For example, an asset group that contains machines that are not connected to the internet may be excluded as they are less susceptible to intrusion.
* You can create an exception for a _single instance of a vulnerability_. For example, a vulnerability may be discovered on each of several ports on a server. However, one of those ports is behind a firewall. You may want to exclude the vulnerability instance that affects that protected port.

###Submitting or re-submitting a request for a global vulnerability exception

A global vulnerability exception means that the application will not report the vulnerability on any asset in your environment that has that vulnerability. Only a Global Administrator can approve requests for global vulnerability exceptions. A user who is not an administrator but who has the correct account permissions can approve vulnerability exceptions that are not global.

Locate the vulnerability for which you want to request an exception. There are several ways to locate to a vulnerability. The following way is easiest for a global exception.

1. Click the **Vulnerabilities** icon of the Security Console Web interface.
The console displays the _Vulnerabilities_ page.
2. Locate the vulnerability in the _Vulnerabilities_ table.

Create and submit the exception request.

1. Look at the _Exceptions_ column for the located vulnerability.
This column displays one of several possible actions. If an exception request has not previously been submitted for that vulnerability, the column displays an **Exclude** icon. If it was submitted and then rejected, the column displays a **Resubmit** icon.
2. Click the icon.

**Tip:** If a vulnerability has an action icon other than **Exclude**, see [Understanding vulnerability exception permissions](doc:working-with-vulnerability-exceptions#section-understanding-vulnerability-exception-permissions).

A _Vulnerability Exception_ dialog box appears. If an exception request was previously submitted and then rejected, read the displayed reasons for the rejection and the user name of the reviewer. This is helpful for tracking previous decisions about the handling of this vulnerability.

3. Select _All instances_ if it is not already displayed from the **Scope** drop-down list.
4. Select a reason for the exception from the drop-down list.
For information about exception reasons, see [Understanding cases for excluding vulnerabilities](doc:working-with-vulnerability-exceptions#section-understanding-cases-for-excluding-vulnerabilities).
5. Enter additional comments.
These are especially helpful for a reviewer to understand your reasons for the request.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "If you select _Other_ as a reason from the drop-down list, additional comments are required."
}
[/block]
6. To create an expiration date, select **Select a date** from the _Expires_ on drop-down list. Specify a date, or use the calendar to select a date.
7. Click **Submit & Approve** to have the exception take effect.
8. (Optional) Click **Submit** to place the exception under review and have another individual in your organization review it.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "Only a Global Administrator can approve a global vulnerability exception."
}
[/block]
Verify the exception (if you submitted _and_ approved it).

##Recalling an exception request that you submitted

You can recall, or cancel, a vulnerability exception request that you submitted if its status remains under review.

Locate the exception request, and verify that it is still under review. The location depends on the scope of the exception. For example, if the exception is for all instances of the vulnerability on a single asset, locate that asset in the _Affects_ table on the details page for the vulnerability. If the link in the Exceptions column is **Under review**, you can recall it.

Recall a single request.

1. Click the **Under Review** link.
2. Click **Recall** in the _Vulnerability Exception_ dialog box.
The link in the _Exceptions_ column changes to **Exclude**.

Recall multiple, simultaneous exception requests.

This procedure is useful if you want to recall a large number of requests because, for example, you've learned that since you submitted them it has become necessary to include them in a report.

1. After locating the exception request as described in the preceding section, select the row for each vulnerability that you want to exclude.
OR
2. To select all the vulnerabilities displayed in the table, click the check box in the top row. Then select the pop-up option **Select Visible**.
3. Click **Recall**.
4. Proceed with the recall workflow as described in the preceding section.
If you've selected multiple vulnerabilities but then want to cancel the selection, click the top row. Then select the pop-up option **Clear All**.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "If you select all listed vulnerabilities for recall, it will only apply to vulnerabilities that are under review. For example, if the _Vulnerabilities_ table includes vulnerabilities that have not been excluded, or have been rejected for exclusion, the global recall will not apply to them."
}
[/block]
##Reviewing an exception request

Upon reviewing a vulnerability exception request, you can either approve or reject it.

1. Locate the exception request.
2. Click the **Administration** icon of the security console Web interface.
3. On the _Administration_ page, click the **Manage** link next to _Vulnerability Exceptions_.
4. Locate the request in the _Vulnerability Exception Listing_ table.
To select multiple requests for review, select each desired row.
OR, to select all requests for review, select the top row.
Selecting multiple requests is useful if you know, for example, that you want to accept or reject multiple requests for the same reason.

Review the request(s).

1. Click the **Under review** link in the _Review Status_ column.
2. Read the comments by the user who submitted the request and decide whether to approve or reject the request.
3. Enter comments in the Reviewer’s Comments text box. Doing so may be helpful for the submitter.
If you want to select an expiration date for the review decision, click the calendar icon and select a date. For example, you may want the exception to be in effect only until a PCI audit is complete.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "You also can click the top row check box to select all requests and then approve or reject them in one step."

##Deleting a vulnerability exception or exception request

Deleting an exception is the only way to override an approved request.

Locate the exception or exception request.

1. Click the **Administration** icon of the security console Web interface.
The console displays the _Administration_ page.
2. Click the **Manage** link next to _Vulnerability Exceptions_.
3. Locate the request in the _Vulnerability Exception Listing_ table.
To select multiple requests for deletion, select each desired row.
OR, to select all requests for deletion, select the top row.

Delete the request(s).

1. Click the **Delete** icon.
The entry(ies) no longer appear in the _Vulnerability Exception Listing_ table. The affected vulnerability(ies) appear in the appropriate vulnerability listing with an **Exclude** icon, which means that a user with appropriate permission can submit an exception request for it.

##Viewing vulnerability exceptions in the Report Card report

When you generate a report based on the default Report Card template, each vulnerability exception appears on the vulnerability list with the reason for its exception.

##How vulnerability exceptions appear in XML and CSV formats

Vulnerability exceptions can be important for the prioritization of remediation projects and for compliance audits. Report templates include a section dedicated to exceptions. See [Vulnerability Exceptions]. In XML and CSV reports, exception information is also available.

_XML:_ The vulnerability test status attribute is set to one of the following values for vulnerabilities suppressed due to an exception:

```exception-vulnerable-exploited - Exception suppressed exploited vulnerability```

```exception-vulnerable-version - Exception suppressed version-checked vulnerability```

```exception-vulnerable-potential - Exception suppressed potential vulnerability```

_CSV_: The vulnerability result-code column will be set to one of the following values for vulnerabilities suppressed due to an exception. Each code corresponds to results of a vulnerability check:

Each code corresponds to results of a vulnerability check:

* _ds_ (skipped, disabled): A check was not performed because it was disabled in the scan template.
* _ee_ (excluded, exploited): A check for an exploitable vulnerability was excluded.
* _ep_ (excluded, potential): A check for a potential vulnerability was excluded.
* _er_ (error during check): An error occurred during the vulnerability check.
* _ev_ (excluded, version check): A check was excluded. It is for a vulnerability that can be identified because the version of the scanned service or application is associated with known vulnerabilities.
* _nt_ (no tests): There were no checks to perform.
* _nv_ (not vulnerable): The check was negative.
* _ov_ (overridden, version check): A check for a vulnerability that would ordinarily be positive because the version of the target service or application is associated with known vulnerabilities was negative due to information from other checks.
* _sd_ (skipped because of DoS settings): sd (skipped because of DOS settings)—If unsafe checks were not enabled in the scan template, the application skipped the check because of the risk of causing denial of service (DOS). See [Configuration steps for vulnerability check settings](doc:selecting-vulnerability-checks#section-configuration-steps-for-vulnerability-check-settings).
* _sv_ (skipped because of inapplicable version): the application did not perform a check because the version of the scanned item is not in the list of checks.
* _uk_ (unknown): An internal issue prevented the application from reporting a scan result.
* _ve_ (vulnerable, exploited): The check was positive. An exploit verified the vulnerability.
* _vp_ (vulnerable, potential): The check for a potential vulnerability was positive.
* _vv_ (vulnerable, version check): The check was positive. The version of the scanned service or software is associated with known vulnerabilities.
