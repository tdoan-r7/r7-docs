##Goals Detail Overview
Click the name link of any goal in your table to see the “Goal Details” page. You can see detailed data surrounding your assets or vulnerabilities by selecting **Assets** or **Vulnerabilities** from the menu dropdown. 

Here's a breakdown of the information you'll find: 

a. **Goal Overview** - Shows general information about the goal. Click the pencil icon to start the goal wizard to edit your goal. 
b. **Goal status bar** - Shows the status of your goal, which can be on track, at risk, or missed. It also shows the number of assets that are compliant or not compliant. 
c. **Data visualization** - If the goal is continuous, you will see a gauge. If your goal is time bound, you will see a graph. 
d. **Select/Deselect All** - Allows you to select or deselect all of your assets or vulnerabilities. To individually select an asset or vulnerability, check the box in front of it. 
e. **Export CSV data** - First, select your desired assets or vulnerabilities. Click **Export to CSV** to download a CSV file.
