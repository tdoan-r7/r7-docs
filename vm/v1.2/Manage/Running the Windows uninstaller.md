Each copy of InsightVM must be installed from scratch. This means that if you already have it installed on your system, you must uninstall it before you install the new copy you downloaded.

Uninstalling completely removes all components. It also deletes sites, configurations, reports, and any scan data on discovered assets, nodes, and vulnerabilities.

To uninstall the application:
1. Start the program to uninstall by doing one of the following:
   * Click the Windows **Start** button and select the **Control Panel**.
   * Select the **uninstall** option or the **remove a program** option (depends on the version of Windows you are running).
   * (If you have a shortcut folder.) Click the Windows **Start** button, go to the InsightVM folder, and select the **Uninstaller**.
2. Double-click InsightVM in the list of programs.
3. Run the uninstaller program.
The uninstaller displays a _Welcome_ page. Read the warning about backing up data.
4. Click **Next**.
The uninstaller displays a status bar with a message that uninstallation is in progress followed by a message that the uninstallation is complete.
Do not close the command line window.
5. Click **Finish**.
