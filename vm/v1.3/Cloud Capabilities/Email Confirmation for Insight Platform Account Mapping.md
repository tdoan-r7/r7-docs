# Why Am I Seeing This?

Several InsightVM cloud capabilities require an insight.rapid7.com account in order to function.  This window triggers if InsightVM does not currently have an Insight account associated with your Security Console login.

  "body": "Security Console logins and insight.rapid7.com accounts are **two entirely different sets of credentials**.  [Verify](doc:activating-your-console-on-the-insight-platform#section-understand-different-user-identifications) that you do indeed have an Insight account before proceeding."

# What If I Don’t Have an Insight Account?

If you don’t have an insight.rapid7.com account yet, fill out and submit the form as shown.  Your information will be recorded and used to prepare a new Insight account. When new features are released, you will receive an email to help you complete the creation of your account.

After you submit the form, you can continue using InsightVM cloud capabilities as usual.

# What If I Already Have an Insight Account?

If you already have an Insight account, use this form to **confirm your existing information**.  Fill out the fields according to the email address that matches your Insight account and submit the form.

If the information you provide produces a successful mapping, dependent InsightVM cloud capabilities will be enabled automatically as they are released.
