#Overview

You can easily see, monitor, and [manage](doc:manage-goals) all of your goals in one place by adding goal cards to new or existing dashboards. Dashboards are customizable drag-and-drop interfaces where you can add cards with data visualizations for various vulnerability management metrics. For more information, see our [Dashboards](doc:dashboards)  and [Cards](doc:cards) Help pages.
