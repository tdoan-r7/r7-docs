Please send the screenshot or listed IP address from the previous section to [Rapid7 Support](https://help.rapid7.com/get-support.html) so we can complete the pairing of the Hosted Engine to your console.

If any message besides the "Cannot refresh scan engine <Scan Engine Name> Unauthorized console connection from <IP address of console>" error is presented, please provide a screenshot of that message.
