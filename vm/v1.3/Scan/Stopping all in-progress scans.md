title: "Stopping all in-progress scans"
excerpt: ""
---
You may find it necessary on occasion to stop any in-progress scans before they complete. There may, for example, be issues causing a disruption to operations on your network or your target assets. Or perhaps scans are running longer than expected, and you need to stop them in order to perform maintenance work on your assets.

If you have multiple scans running you can stop them all simultaneously with one action.

When you run any of the stopped scans again, they start from the beginning.
