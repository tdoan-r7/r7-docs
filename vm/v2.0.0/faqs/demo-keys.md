# Using a Demo Key

After you install AppSpider Pro, you'll be given the option to enter a product license key. If you do not have a product license key, you can click **Cancel** to use a demo key. The demo key allows you to trial and evaluate a limited version of AppSpider Pro until you are ready to make a purchasing decision. The demo key does not expire.

There are some restrictions to the demo key, including:

- You'll be restricted to running scans against www.webscantest.com and scanme.ntobjectives.com. 
 
- Generating WAF policies will be disabled.

- Detailed logging will be disabled.

- Vulnerability Editor will be disabled.

- Proxy support will be disabled. 
 
- You can only run 3 concurrent scans.

When you are ready to purchase AppSpider Pro, please contact our [support team](https://www.rapid7.com/support/) to get a license key. The support team will ask you for your reference code, which you can find by going to **Help \> License \> Update License \> Using a License Key**.

After they receive the reference code, they'll send you a license key, which you can use to activate AppSpider Pro.
