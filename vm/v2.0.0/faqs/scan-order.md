# What order does AppSpider use to scan my URLs?

Any URLs that are on the on the lower part of the crawler restrictions page will overwrite the ones that are listed higher up. You can edit your scan configuration to target what you want to scan. The URL list of the scan configuration page lists all the URLs that the scan targets. You can use the Up and Down arrows to modify the position of the URL in the list.

If there is still an issue, please create a support ticket and upload the following:

- The scan configuration, named ScanName.scfg, which is generally located in MyDocuments\rapid7\Scans\ScanName.

- A screen capture of the all links report with the link that has mistakenly been crawled, with highlights if possible.
