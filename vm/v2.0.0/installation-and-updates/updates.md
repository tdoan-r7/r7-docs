# Updating AppSpider

An notification message will alert you that an update is available when you log in to AppSpider Pro.

You can click on the notification message to access the download link for the latest installer. Or you can go directly to [https://www.rapid7.com/products/appspider/download.jsp](../getting-started/getting-started-pro.htm) to download the latest installer.

Running the installer will take you through the set up process again, except this time, it will update AppSpider Pro to the latest version.
